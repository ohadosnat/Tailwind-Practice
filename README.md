# Tailwind Project
Hey everyone! New project! <br>
In this project I wanted to try and practice Tailwind CSS. <br>
I find Tailwind CSS a great framework, that is easy to learn.
## About this project
This project was all about using Tailwind, and what I learned. <br>
The design I used was a design I did a few years ago during my **Daily UI Challenge**. <br>
FACES is a clothing brand I used to have, this is one of the designs.
<br><br>
***As always, If you got any suggestions/feedback/tips about my code. Feel free to reach out and help me learn!*** :smile:
<br><br>
That's all for today! See you next time! <br>
